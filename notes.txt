Add shields that regenerate each round
- then the shield can be used a resource to gather information on face down cards. You can take some damage since you'll just get them back

maybe this shouldn't be a memory game but an exploration game. Each facedown tile is an unknown location. Then the goal as the player is to reveal enough of the map 
to achieve something, Getting out? killing an enemy? i dunno

Maybe you're fighting an enemy you flip cards to do things and the facedown cards are cards in your deck.

maybe its a deckbuilder. You draw cards that effect the board. and maybe some of the tiles you flip affects your hand. Like you can flip a card that draws you a card
